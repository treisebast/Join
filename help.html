                    <p><span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                        by a group of dedicated

                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span>
                        leverages the principles of
                        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                                <p>When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
                                    This board represents your
                                    project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                                    and
                                    "Done".

                                <p>In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                                    projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                    section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                                    these
                                    contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                                    card.
                                    Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                                    assignees,
                                    etc.

                                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                    when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
