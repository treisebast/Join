                Personal data (usually referred to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent
                necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its

            <p>
                Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter
                referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to any operation or set of operations such as
                collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval,
                consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment,
                or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated
                means or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose,
                duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
                with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website
                and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect
                and control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our privacy policy is structured as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>
                II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>
                III. Information about the data processing<br>
            </p>
            <h2>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h2>
            <p>
                The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sebastian Treittinger</li>
                <li>Marco Ammann</li>
                <li>Joost Heidrich</li>
                <li>Ghulammustafa Kakar</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>
            <p>
                With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have
                the
                right
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
                    processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
                    also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if
                    further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
                    per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
                <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same
                    transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
                    processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
                corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.
                However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
                disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the
                    controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular,
                    an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>III. Information about the data processing</h2>
            <p>
                Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its
                storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
                obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
            </p>
            <h2>Customer account/registration</h2>
            <p>
                If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the data you entered during
                registration (e.g. your name, your address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading up
                to your potential placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with us, to
                fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of
                your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function). We also store your IP address and
                the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with
                reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your
                customer account.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this
                processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual
                relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is
                also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7 Para.
                3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary.
                However,
                we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.
            </p>
            <h2>Server data</h2>
            <p>
                For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider
                will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the
                type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the
                webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you
                visited our site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the
                improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for
                evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the
                investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
